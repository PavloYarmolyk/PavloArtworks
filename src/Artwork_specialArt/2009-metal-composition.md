The composition of metal parts of old bicycles and other metal parts is transformed into the shape of a creature.


The wheel in front of it symbolizes the eye.


Symbolizes movement as a way of seeing the world, a whirlwind of events that captures everything around.


The metal composition was created through the author's passion for cycling.
